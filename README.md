# MEDePROM Healthhack 2025
MEDePROM is an AI-powered platform that transforms Patient Reported Outcomes Measures (PROMs) by replacing rigid, repetitive surveys with an interactive, generative AI-driven chat interface that encourages engagement, adapts follow-up questions, and supports both text and voice communication for greater inclusivity. It automatically converts qualitative patient responses into PROM scores using advanced algorithms, providing richer, more actionable insights. Designed as a modular framework, MEDePROM supports various PROM questionnaires and aims to integrate with existing healthcare platforms, making patient reporting more insightful, accessible, and effective.
